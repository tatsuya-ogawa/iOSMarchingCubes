# iOS Marching Cubes
This project demonstrates how to generate a mesh for the Stanford Bunny using the Marching Cubes algorithm and visualize it using SceneKit. Additionally, it provides functionality to export the generated mesh as an OBJ file.

## Features
Marching Cubes implementation for the Stanford Bunny dataset
Visualization of the resulting mesh using SceneKit
Exporting the generated mesh as an OBJ file

## Requirements
Xcode 13 or later
iOS 15.0 or later
Getting Started
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Xcode.
Run the project on a physical device or the iOS Simulator.
After running the project, you will see the Stanford Bunny mesh generated by the Marching Cubes algorithm displayed in the SceneKit view. You can interact with the mesh using touch gestures.

## Exporting to OBJ File
To export the generated mesh as an OBJ file, follow these steps:

Tap the "Export" button in the app.
Choose a directory to save the OBJ file.
The app will export the mesh as an OBJ file to the chosen directory.
You can then import the OBJ file into other 3D modeling software or use it in other projects.
